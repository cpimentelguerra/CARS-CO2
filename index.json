Some studies have investigated the effect of different foliar-applied K compounds; however, most studies have focussed on crop quality and yield parameters, or were performed with isolated leaf cuticles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rates of the foliar ion penetration and leaf surface deposition of 130 mM K sprays of compounds with markedly different point of deliquescence (POD) and efflorescence (POE) values, the rates having been previously estimated in climate chamber trials. Shoots of field-grown, commercial olive trees were sprayed with K-nitrate (KNO3), K-sulphate (K2SO4), K-chloride (KCl), K-phosphate (K3PO4), K-carbonate (K2CO3) and K-bicarbonate (KHCO3), and leaf samples were collected after 3 and 24 h. Cation and anion concentrations were determined in the leaf tissues, and in a preliminary leaf water wash for estimating surface-deposited ion concentrations. No significant leaf tissue K increments were recorded between the K sprays. Olive tissue anion concentrations showed different patterns, and a chloride (Cl−) increase was detected 3 h after the foliar KCl supply. On the other hand, the foliar K applications led to leaf nitrate changes regardless of the K source supplied. High amounts of K and accompanying ions were recovered in the washing liquid of the foliar K-supplied leaves. Some foliar K treatments increased the leaf surface concentration of sulphate and chloride, suggesting a potential effect on leaf cell anion extrusion. Hence, despite no evidence of foliar K uptake, an effect of leaf anion concentrations was observed, indicating that foliar nutrient sprays may influence leaf and leaf surface anion balance.","tags":["foliar fertilization","olive","leaf","potassium"],"title":"Foliar Application of Potassium Salts to Olive, with Focus on Accompanying Anions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katarzyna Berent","Julyan H.

If you want to know what the objectives of this project are, you can read the project summary below. The results of the research will be presented in future posts.\nCARS-CO2 is a multidisciplinary project that is centred on the carbonatation of sulphates to establish a novel route to capture and store atmospheric CO2. The two main objectives of this project are: (i) improve our understanding of the crystallization process of sulphates and carbonates at mild hydrothermal conditions, and (ii) study the mechanism, kinetics and stability of the carbonatation of sulphates. Both objectives are paramount to accomplish our foremost goal, which is to evaluate the potential of sulphate carbonatation as a “sequestrator” of CO2. To achieve this, several state-of-the-art laboratory and synchrotron-based scattering techniques will be used to monitor in situ the mineral formation and transformation reactions. To complement the body of bulk mineralization data, during a secondment, isotopic fingerprinting will be used to determine the role of magnesium in the transformation reaction and to define if the transformation is solid state or solution mediated. The results obtained in this project will not only shed light on how CaSO4-based (waste) materials can help to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere but will also further unveil the formation mechanisms of sulphates and carbonates for relevant environmental conditions on Earth and Mars.\n","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655911655,"objectID":"a54e6ac86a3680d6ce1777d49ec21d04","permalink":"https://cpimentelguerra.com/CARS-CO2/post/2022-02-01-project-abstract/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/CARS-CO2/post/2022-02-01-project-abstract/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to the CARS-CO2 project webpage.
