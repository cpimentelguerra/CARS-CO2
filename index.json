The optimum conditions for the efficient production of bassanite in a short time (4 M and maintaining a temperature, T  80 °C. When the solution containing bassanite crystals is cooled down to around room temperature, eventually gypsum is formed. When the temperature is raised again to T  80 °C, bassanite is rapidly re-precipitated. This contrasts with the better-known behaviour of the bassanite phase in low-salt environments. In low-salinity aqueous solutions, bassanite is considered to be metastable with respect to gypsum and anhydrite, and therefore gypsum-to-bassanite conversion does not occur in pure water. Interestingly, the high-salinity transformation of gypsum-to-bassanite has been reported by many authors and used in practice for several decades, although its very occurrence actually contradicts numerical thermodynamic predictions regarding solubility of calcium sulfate phases. By following the evolution of crystalline phases with in situ and time-resolved X-ray diffraction/scattering and Raman spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the phase stability in brines at elevated temperatures was inaccurately represented in the thermodynamic databases. Most notably for c(NaCl)  4 M, and T  80 °C gypsum becomes readily more soluble than bassanite, which induces the direct precipitation of the latter from gypsum. The fact that these transformations are controlled by the solution provides extensive opportunities for precise manipulation of crystal formation. Our experiments confirmed that bassanite remained the sole crystalline phase for many hours before reverting into gypsum. This property is extremely advantageous for practical processing and efficient crystal extraction in industrial scenarios.","tags":["Bassanite","Brines","Calcium sulfate","Gypsum","Nucleation","Raman spectroscopy","Scattering","Synchrotron","Transformation"],"title":"Solution-driven processing of calcium sulfate: The mechanism of the reversible transformation of gypsum to bassanite in brines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Carlos M.

However, there is controversy about the effectiveness of such sparingly soluble nutrient sources as foliar fertilizers. In this work, we focussed on analysing the effect of adding Ca-carbonate (calcite, CaCO3) micro- and nano-particles as model sparingly soluble mineral compounds to foliar fertilizer formulations in terms of increasing the rate of foliar absorption. For these purposes, we carried out short-term foliar application experiments by treating leaves of species with variable surface features and wettability rates. The leaf absorption efficacy of foliar formulations containing a surfactant and model soluble nutrient sources, namely Ca-chloride (CaCl2), magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), potassium nitrate (KNO3), or zinc sulphate (ZnSO4), was evaluated alone or after addition of calcite particles. In general, the combination of the Ca-carbonate particles with an essential element salt had a synergistic effect and improved the absorption of Ca and the nutrient element provided. In light of the positive effects of using calcite particles as foliar formulation adjuvants, dolomite nano- and micro-particles were also tested as foliar formulation additives, and the results were also positive in terms of increasing foliar uptake. The observed nutrient element foliar absorption efficacy can be partially explained by geochemical modelling, which enabled us to predict how these formulations will perform at least in chemical terms. Our results show the major potential of adding mineral particles as foliar formulation additives, but the associated mechanisms of action and possible additional benefits to plants should be characterised in future investigations.","tags":["carbonate minerals","foliar uptake","adjuvants","foliar fertilizers","geochemical modelling"],"title":"Mineral particles in foliar fertilizer formulations can improve the rate of foliar uptake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Neriman Tuba Barlas","Héctor A.

For this purpose, a greenhouse pot experiment was conducted with lettuce (very wettable), broccoli (highly unwettable) and leek (highly unwettable). Foliar sprays contained 0.1% surfactant plus 100 mM Mg supplied as MgCl2·6H2O, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O or MgSO4·7H2O. Leaf Mg concentrations were determined 1 and 7 days after foliar application. Anion concentrations were also measured in lettuce where a significant foliar Mg absorption was detected. Leaf wettability, leaf surface free energy and fertilizer drop deposit appearance onto the foliage were assessed. It is concluded that despite including a surfactant in the spray formulation, leaf wettability plays a major role in foliar Mg absorption.","tags":["crops","foliar uptake","hygroscopic salts","leaf anions","leaf wetting"],"title":"Evaluating Leaf Wettability and Salt Hygroscopicity as Drivers for Foliar Absorption","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The concept paper we published about the chemobrionics database in ChemSystemsChem has been selected by the editors of Chemistry Europe and can now be found in the Editors' Choice: Spotlights section.\n   ","date":1681689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681742828,"objectID":"8a375ebc26ab68f27dfb85953b68b250","permalink":"https://cpimentelguerra.com/CARS-CO2/post/2023-04-17-editors-spotlights/","publishdate":"2023-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/CARS-CO2/post/2023-04-17-editors-spotlights/","section":"post","summary":"The concept paper we published about the chemobrionics database in ChemSystemsChem has been selected by the editors of Chemistry Europe and can now be found in the Editors' Choice: Spotlights section.","tags":[],"title":"Concept paper highlighted by editors","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carlos Pimentel","Mingchuan Zheng","Julyan H.

Some studies have investigated the effect of different foliar-applied K compounds; however, most studies have focussed on crop quality and yield parameters, or were performed with isolated leaf cuticles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rates of the foliar ion penetration and leaf surface deposition of 130 mM K sprays of compounds with markedly different point of deliquescence (POD) and efflorescence (POE) values, the rates having been previously estimated in climate chamber trials. Shoots of field-grown, commercial olive trees were sprayed with K-nitrate (KNO3), K-sulphate (K2SO4), K-chloride (KCl), K-phosphate (K3PO4), K-carbonate (K2CO3) and K-bicarbonate (KHCO3), and leaf samples were collected after 3 and 24 h. Cation and anion concentrations were determined in the leaf tissues, and in a preliminary leaf water wash for estimating surface-deposited ion concentrations. No significant leaf tissue K increments were recorded between the K sprays. Olive tissue anion concentrations showed different patterns, and a chloride (Cl−) increase was detected 3 h after the foliar KCl supply. On the other hand, the foliar K applications led to leaf nitrate changes regardless of the K source supplied. High amounts of K and accompanying ions were recovered in the washing liquid of the foliar K-supplied leaves. Some foliar K treatments increased the leaf surface concentration of sulphate and chloride, suggesting a potential effect on leaf cell anion extrusion. Hence, despite no evidence of foliar K uptake, an effect of leaf anion concentrations was observed, indicating that foliar nutrient sprays may influence leaf and leaf surface anion balance.","tags":["foliar fertilization","olive","leaf","potassium"],"title":"Foliar Application of Potassium Salts to Olive, with Focus on Accompanying Anions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katarzyna Berent","Julyan H.

If you want to know what the objectives of this project are, you can read the project summary below. The results of the research will be presented in future posts.\nCARS-CO2 is a multidisciplinary project that is centred on the carbonatation of sulphates to establish a novel route to capture and store atmospheric CO2. The two main objectives of this project are: (i) improve our understanding of the crystallization process of sulphates and carbonates at mild hydrothermal conditions, and (ii) study the mechanism, kinetics and stability of the carbonatation of sulphates. Both objectives are paramount to accomplish our foremost goal, which is to evaluate the potential of sulphate carbonatation as a “sequestrator” of CO2. To achieve this, several state-of-the-art laboratory and synchrotron-based scattering techniques will be used to monitor in situ the mineral formation and transformation reactions. To complement the body of bulk mineralization data, during a secondment, isotopic fingerprinting will be used to determine the role of magnesium in the transformation reaction and to define if the transformation is solid state or solution mediated. The results obtained in this project will not only shed light on how CaSO4-based (waste) materials can help to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere but will also further unveil the formation mechanisms of sulphates and carbonates for relevant environmental conditions on Earth and Mars.\n","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655911655,"objectID":"a54e6ac86a3680d6ce1777d49ec21d04","permalink":"https://cpimentelguerra.com/CARS-CO2/post/2022-02-01-project-abstract/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/CARS-CO2/post/2022-02-01-project-abstract/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to the CARS-CO2 project webpage.
